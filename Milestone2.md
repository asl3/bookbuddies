# Milestone 2

We accomplished all the tasks we set out to implement in our Proposal doc for the Milestone 2 phase. These include:

- Displaying a map
  - Displaying user location and friends/bookstores nearby
- Integrate Firebase Authentication to allow logging in and creating accounts
- Integrate Firestore database to introduce real data into the application
- Adding functionality to add, remove, and view friends
