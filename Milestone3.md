# Milestone 3

We accomplished all the tasks we set out to implement in our Proposal doc for the Milestone 3 phase, with some modifications to the initial scope. These include:

- UPDATE: Random reminder to read (as opposed to posting pictures)
    - We defined a post to be a change in reading status, so we want to be consistent
- Display stats about reading breakdown
    - Pie chart for genres
    - Bar graph for books finished
- Use API to get library data
- Update search to populate from user data for books already in collection and to show accurate book detail views
- Access book library through user search (by tapping on ListTile), and see book info and journal (only if public)
