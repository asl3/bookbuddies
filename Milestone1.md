# Milestone 1

We accomplished all the tasks we set out to implement in our Proposal doc for the Milestone 1 phase. These include:

- Adding/deleting books to your collection
- Connect to GoogleBooks API to search for books
- Track progress on books (plan to read, reading, finished reading)
- Journal associated with book for notetaking (option to make it viewable publicly/to friends/private)
